### How to get your SMTP credentials

To be able to send messages with this contact form, you'll need a working SMTP service. InfinityFree does not provide this with free hosting, but you can use third party SMTP services.

### How to get your reCAPTCHA credentials

To prevent spammers from being able to abuse your contact form, reCAPTCHA has been integrated by default. reCAPTCHA is a free service from Google which can prevent automated scripts from using your form.

This contact form has been integrated with reCAPTCHA v2 with the Checkbox challenge. To use this, you will need to setup your site in reCAPTCHA like so:

1. Go to the reCAPTCHA admin console: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
2. Enter a label you can use to identify your website.
3. Choose the reCAPTCHA type "reCAPTCHA v2" and the version "Invisible".
4. Under Domains, enter the domain name of your website.
5. Accept the reCAPTCHA terms and click Send.
